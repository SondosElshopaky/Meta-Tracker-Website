# Meta-Tracker-Website

I created this website during my internship at METAS in 2023. This is the initial unofficial website version to market "Meta-Tracker" application that haven't been released yet.

In this Project, I used HTML and CSS, as well as some JavaScript libraries to animate some elements.

Note that some buttons won't redirect you to the preferred page; this will be fixed when Meta-Tracker is released, so that it redirects you successfully.
